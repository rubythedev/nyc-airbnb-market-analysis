## Project Objectives
1. Identify the most popular neighborhoods in Manhattan for vacation rentals.
2. Determine the optimal property size to target for investment.
3. Calculate occupancy rates and average prices across properties.
4. Estimate annual revenue potential based on occupancy and price trends.
5. Offer recommendations for property investment based on data insights.

## Methodology
The project methodology follows these steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: Reviewed, filtered, and cleaned the dataset to ensure relevant data was used in the analysis.
2. **Neighborhood Analysis**: Standardized neighborhood labels and analyzed reviews to find popular areas.
3. **Property Size Analysis**: Identified the most rented property sizes and filtered properties with at least one review in the last 12 months.
4. **Occupancy Calculation**: Used calendar data to calculate occupancy rates by creating a new `occupied` column.
5. **Revenue Estimation**: Calculated potential revenue based on average occupancy rates and prices for top-performing neighborhoods.
6. **Executive Summary and Recommendations**: Compiled key findings and provided actionable insights.

## Key Findings
- **Popular Neighborhoods**: The Lower East Side, Hell's Kitchen, and Harlem are the top neighborhoods for vacation rentals based on review counts.
- **Optimal Property Size**: One-bedroom apartments are the most rented property type, especially in popular neighborhoods.
- **Occupancy Trends**: Higher occupancy rates are observed over weekends, with slight declines during weekdays.
- **Revenue Potential**: Properties in the most popular neighborhoods with consistent occupancy can achieve high annual revenues, making them attractive for investment.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that investing in one-bedroom apartments in popular neighborhoods like the Lower East Side and Hell's Kitchen can yield high occupancy and potential revenue. Occupancy rates tend to be higher on weekends, which can be beneficial for targeting short-term vacation rentals.

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Expand Dataset**: Consider additional years of data to analyze seasonal trends.
2. **Refine Occupancy Rate Estimation**: Utilize more accurate measures of occupancy if available, rather than relying solely on review counts.
3. **Market Segmentation**: Further segment the data by amenities offered to see if certain features increase occupancy and rental price.

---

## Future Directions
1. **Advanced Analysis of Amenities**: Explore the impact of specific amenities (e.g., doorman, instant booking) on occupancy rates and revenue.
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Implement predictive analytics to forecast high-demand periods and adjust pricing strategies accordingly.
3. **Competitor Analysis**: Compare other rental platforms to provide a holistic view of the vacation rental market in Manhattan.
