## Overview
This project involves analyzing the vacation rental market in Manhattan, New York City, using advanced spreadsheet techniques. The goal is to provide insights to a consulting company on potential investment properties in the Airbnb market. The analysis is based on the NYC Airbnb dataset, focusing on listings, occupancy rates, and neighborhood preferences.

## Project Structure
The project consists of several parts, each contributing to the overall analysis:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
   - Downloaded and reviewed the NYC Airbnb dataset.
   - Identified and documented data cleaning challenges.
   - Filtered listings to include only relevant properties (e.g., those with at least one review and a minimum night requirement of 7 days or fewer).
   - Standardized neighborhood names and handled missing data.

2. **Property Targeting Analysis**:
   - Analyzed which types of properties are most sought after based on occupancy rates and reviews.
   - Created pivot tables to identify the most popular neighborhoods and property sizes.

3. **Occupancy Calculations**:
   - Aggregated data to calculate occupancy rates using pivot tables.
   - Analyzed trends in occupancy based on the day of the week.

4. **Revenue Estimation**:
   - Estimated annual revenue for properties based on average prices and occupancy rates.
   - Created visualizations (bar charts) to depict how occupancy changes throughout the week.

5. **Attributes Impact Analysis**:
   - Investigated the correlation between property attributes (e.g., amenities, review ratings) and rental performance.

6. **Documentation and Formatting**:
   - Created an Executive Summary sheet and Table of Contents for easy navigation.
   - Ensured all data cleaning steps were documented and assumptions were clearly outlined.
